The merchant will get paid for this transaction if it remains in this status. * `REVERSED` - A Transaction that had a status of PREAUTHORIZED or CAPTURED has subsequently been reversed which voids/cancels a transaction before it is funded and attempts to restore the payer's spending limit for that payment method. * `DECLINED` - A Transaction where the payment method provider declined to authorize the transfer of fund between the payer and the merchant. * `FUNDED` - A Transaction where the funds have transferred between payer and merchant as expected. * `REJECTED` - A Transaction where the funds are expected to transfer between payer and merchant but the transfer was rejected during the funding process.
