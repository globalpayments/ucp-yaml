      summary: |
        Cancel a transaction before funds are exchanged.
      description: |
        Transactions can be reversed in full or partially reversed. 

        An attempt to restore Payer's spending limit is always made. 

        If no amount is included in the request body, the full value of the transaction will be reversed.  

        In timeout scenarios, where the integrator does not recieve a response at all, the reference field
        can be used in place of the id in the URL

        Availability of partial reversals depends on your live configuration.

        This request will change the transaction status to PENDING_REVIEW (HELD). If the transaction was successful and due to be included in the next settlement file, this will prevent its inclusion until such a time that the transaction is released. 
        If you're using Delayed Capture (the original capture_mode is set to LATER), the transaction must be released and then captured before it will be batched. This functionality is only available for Card Not Present (CNP) transactions in the UK, US, CA and EU.

        - Release a Transaction
      summary: |
        This request will return a transaction to it's previous state before it was set to to PENDING_REVIEW (HELD). 
      description: |-
        If a transaction is set to PENDING_REVIEW (Held), the release request will return the transaction to its original status. 
        For example, if a transaction was set to automatically capture (capture_mode=AUTO), then the release request will return it to a status of CAPTURED.
        If you're using differect capture_modes,  MULTIPLE or LATER, the transaction will simply return to the PREAUTHRORIZED status. 
        Transactions that are held must be released before they are captured.

        This functionality is only available for Card Not Present (CNP) transactions in the UK, US, CA and EU.

                                * `CAPTURED` - A Transaction has been successfully authorized and captured. The funding process will commence once the transaction remains in this status. 
                                * `REVERSED` - A Transaction that had a status of PENDING, PREAUTHORIZED or CAPTURED has subsequently been reversed which voids/cancels a transaction before it is funded. 
                                * `DECLINED` - A Transaction where the payment method provider declined the transfer of funds between the payer and the merchant. 
                                * `FUNDED` - A Transaction where the funds have transferred between payer and merchant as expected. 
                                * `FAILED` - A Transaction that experienced an error after it was successfully created on Global Payments. For example a transaction that was successfully initiated and sent to a terminal/device that subsequently experienced an issue.                         
                                * `REJECTED` - A Transaction where the funds were expected to transfer between payer and merchant but the transfer was rejected during the funding process. This rarely happens but when it does it is usually addressed by Global Payments operations.
                                * `FOR_REVIEW `- A Transaction is being created with key information like amount and goods and services being purchased.It must be reviewed and subsequently actioned before going for authorization. This status is used if the transaction needs to be shown to the payer before proceeding to authorization.
                                * `INITIATED` - A Transaction has been successfully initiated. An update on its status is expected via a separate asynchronous notification to a webhook. 
                                * `PENDING` - A Transaction has been sent to the payment method provider and are waiting for a result. 
                                * `PREAUTHORIZED` - A Transaction has been approved but a capture request is required to commence the movement of funds.
