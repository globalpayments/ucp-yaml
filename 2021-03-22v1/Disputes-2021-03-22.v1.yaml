              This field indicates the distinct step a dispute is at, within the dispute lifecycle.
                      * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                      * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                      * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                      * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                      * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                      * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                      * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                      * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                      * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                      This field indicates the distinct step a dispute is at, within the dispute lifecycle.
                              * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                              * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                              * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                              * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                              * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                              * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                              * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                              * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                              * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                              * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                              * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                              * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                              * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                              * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                              * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                              * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                              * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                      * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                      * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                      * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                      * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                      * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                      * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                      * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                      * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                      * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                        * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                        * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                        * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                        * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                        * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                        * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.

                        * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                          * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                          * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                          * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                          * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                          * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                          * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                          * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                          * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                          * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

            This field indicates the distinct step a dispute is at, within the dispute lifecycle.
                    * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                    * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                    * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                    * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                    * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                    * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                    * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                    * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                    * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                        * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                        * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.

                          * `RETRIEVAL` - Request for proof that a transaction was valid. Merchant must supply documentation within a specific timeframe. No financial adjustments are performed however, if the timeframe expires before there is a response, the merchant can be held liable.
                          * `CHARGEBACK` - The cardholder or issuing bank disputes a transaction and funds are returned to the issuer/cardholder. The merchant can accept or challenge the dispute by supplying documentation proving the transaction was valid.
                          * `REVERSAL` - The issuer decides the chargeback submitted is invalid. If funds were taken from the merchant, those funds are returned. 
                          * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                          * `PRE_ARBITRATION` - This is a further subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
                          * `ARBITRATION` - This is the final escalation stage where the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                          * `PRE_COMPLIANCE` - An initial compliance violation of the card processing rules that are defined by the relevant card association.
                          * `COMPLIANCE` - This is the final compliance escalation stage created wherein the card brand is asked to rule on the dispute.
                          * `GOODFAITH` - This is a request to accept liability for a case on a good faith basis, even though the final deadline for resolving the case has passed.

                    * `SECOND_CHARGEBACK` - This is a subsequent escalation of a chargeback wherein the issuer/cardholder continues to dispute the transaction after the merchant has responded to defend the case.
