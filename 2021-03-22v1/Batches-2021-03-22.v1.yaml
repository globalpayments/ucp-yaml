  title: Batches
  description: |
    A Batch represents a group of transactions that commence the funding process together.  Batches have aggregate amount and count totals of all the transactions in the batch.
    Once a batch is closed all transactions assigned to that batch will be funded to the merchant.
    Once a batch is closed no more transactions can be added or removed from that batch. 
    Transactions that are in a closed batch cannot be cancelled/reversed and must be refunded.
